This puddle is brimming with invisible life
a frog goes hopping by
I see every pore 
opening and closing
like tiny mouths
gasping for life
A tree sprouts and grows
spiraling endlessly upwards
a vibrant kaleidoscope
of living textures
in every fiber
This cloud is raining on us
but the water is inside out
and plays down our faces
like forest creatures
I raise my arms
and birds fly out
of the bush behind us
pelting us with a warm hail
where from instantly sprouts
fifteen eyes each
We are all looking and feeling
in this dizzying whirlwind
And there is nowhere to stop
and marvel at the forms going by
because the forms keep happening
spinning us around
A tiny toad
turns into the world
and emits us
in a flower stream
over the precipice
of the most glorious waterfall
the jagged facets below
still far away
And I see a glint in the sun
like it is winking
I wink back
with too many eyes
and wonder when I will begin
to fall
