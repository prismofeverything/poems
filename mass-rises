A mass rises
into the sky
dropping debris and soil
into the crater it leaves behind
It is still shedding layers
so it is hard to know
what is under all that
vines and grasses and clots of soil
sliding off like butter
A melting world
And the core of this entity
unearthing itself even as it rises
emits an almost inaudible hum
and as the layers slough tumbling
downwards
light beams start to pierce
the extraneous sliding matter
creating brief flashes
until it burns
like a blinding sun
that you can't stop staring at
until your eyes
become suns
and you see
only the remnants
of this blinding moment
of revelation
for eternity
