One thin line
becomes the world
We live in this line
walking back and forth
up its endless extent
We plant trees
and eat figs
The fig tree is thin
but the figs are sweet
and the juice is striking
in its refreshing immediacy
I build a house here
it is narrow
but warm
My fire dances
along the boundary
a geometric burning
I lift my glass
and the cool liquid inside
sparkles in the firelight
It is so rich
this world of ours
that we don't even see
the adjacent lines
lying so close
if you reached the right way
you could pluck it
and send their world
to singing
I dream of these worlds
but aren't they just other lines?
What I truly long for
is a plane
to stretch out in
and maybe even
run sideways
for awhile
But this longing for dimensionality
has no end
and so I sip from my glass
and find content
while the singing
drowns out all sound
