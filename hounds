Three hounds seek the center
a Bolt through the ground
splitting sundered
radiating heat mist
All of the stars funnel happily
into its maw
You stand atop
a mound of earth
rings of fire
encircling your form
Five pillars descend
and fix a scaffold
for the stairway
you ascend
Behind everything
a great forge
turns chaos
into fabric
And wraps raw spirit
into form
that wails and gnashes
at its own flesh
It hovers there
where the stairway cleaves through
creating a shaft of symmetry
that rises above clouds
of wrenching struggle
and beholds the mountains
of reality
leaking into a vast
rainbow sea
