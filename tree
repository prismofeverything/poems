The tree gives all
spinning seeds falling
confetti vitality spraying the world
rainbow streamers catching fire
A thousand voices rise in song
a vibrant sea of tonality
to catch each seed
in a net of light
They sprout
spiraling upward
a flurry of green richness
dripping with dew
In this generative setting
countless tiny minds spring forth
each one a leaf
each one a mouth
devouring the photons
that issue from the great tree
We sit below
and read a poem
out loud
and the world dances
around us
and you cannot tell
who is creating who
