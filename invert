We fall in the water
into a world
inverted from ours
The fish are upside down
and the snails are omniscient
Radiating from their viscous scales
is all of reality
I drink it in
becoming full
of light
And the water inverts again
inwardly this time
and all of my cells
are on the outside
I pluck at each one like a string
and tones of life emerge
merging and uniting
with the passage of the silent all-knowing snails
until I hover
over an endless sky
and the lake above me
drinks
