Maximum incarnation 
is not really possible 
because it would saturate 
everything 
and no one 
would be able 
to breathe 
and the fire 
would be consuming itself 
which would produce more of itself 
in a kaleidoscope of form 
and color 
Moderate incarnation is more likely 
but in general 
we have only 
mild 
incarnation 
which while not ideal 
is at least 
textural 
and leads to green paths 
where a single flower 
begets the majesty 
of a generative 
endless mulch 
spewing into your eyes
