One blade of grass came poking up out of the floor
The next day, there were two
Soon I had a forest in my bathroom
I scrambled over branches to get to bed
in a pristine pool of tranquil cosmos
When I woke up
I was in a tree
I looked out over the world
vines curling over every surface
The faraway sun
devoured by the canopy
but tiny shafts getting through
and painting the overgrowth
with vibrant neon
dancing in the wind
