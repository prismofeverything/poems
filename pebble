Later in time
a
small pebble
                is in 
       the stream
The flow
          flows
      around it
and doesn't notice really
and the pebble
          notices
             everything
it reaches out
        a kind of stalk
       of wanting
and taps into
     the
            flow
The sensations 
      are
          over
                  whelming
     it tries to
 sense
everything
          it can
and even then
       it can only sense
              so
    much
A trembling
     awareness
seeps
        outward
      electrified with
    immediacy
The flow
      starts 
           warping
    around the pebble
    articulating
           softly
 upon its surface
and gaining
       a kind of
    structure
through time
a network
       of
            constraints
that translate
   an open
and eternal flow
    into an experience
           of facets
        and hands
