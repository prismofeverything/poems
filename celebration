The procession
is just arriving
They carry their deity
in celebration
They have been practicing
for years
Every entity
has a call
that they shake
in their fists
as their legs
pound into the dark earth
And the babbling stream
picks up speed
color in bursts
spangling the land
and the Dragon
takes form
a fiery tunnel
cut through the green flora
Its claws
like planets
emitting a call
that it shakes
with the trees
And the rocks tumble forth
as it is revealed
that our humble world
is but an egg
for the Mass
cosmic triangulation
Eternity stab
and I wonder softly
how many shards
I can cling to
in open space
