Where do you think
all the butterflies come from? 
Maybe a tunnel deep underground
where they are harvested for food
by pale and blind inhabitants
and we only see
the enterprising fugitives who escape
Or maybe a child
makes origami all day
and his unrecognized skill
imbues them with life
They go a little disoriented
but inspired by a formless drive
scattering into the world
and upon a rich and fateful life
reduce back to paper in death
Maybe they were all a single vast butterfly
that shattered into countless fragments
each a shard of mirror
looking into their own souls
Maybe like the electron
they are all the same butterfly
traveling back and forth through time and space
every once in awhile colliding with an anti butterfly version
of their own timeless journey
Or maybe, they all emerged
from the moments I loved you
and why they now blanket the earth
