Walking up the spiral
it's turning green
or greener
from a stark bone white
The contour grows in astonishment
as I rise
until the path is as wide as the ocean
and I fall in
I don't know how to swim in spiral
but the spiral denizens seem to care
and give me breath while they pull me to the surface
They swim around me singing
and I think this is some kind of ceremony for them
maybe they have met people before
But if so, where are they all now? 
Perhaps this is them
and I will soon be one of these sleek majestic beasts
saving the ignorant from drowning
I can feel the tones working their transformation
as I watch my fingers grow and merge
and my fear and panic dissolve
leaving white trails on the deep green sea
