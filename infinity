A tidal pool
contains a world
of tiny lives
each from the inside
as large as the universe

How can we be so vast on the inside,
and small on the outside?
Why do I not take up
every universe
with my extent? 

Why can I reach into my soul
and never find the boundary?

It is like a door
that I open
into infinity
I gaze into that hallway
of stars and fiery dust
of black holes and singularities
and somehow I am all this
and more

I breathe in
and it fills this space with power
I breathe out
and infinity still remains

Some day
I will sink into this space
All the matter of my being
seeping like black water
into the void
and my bounds
will finally meet
the boundless
and dissolve

This infinity I enclose with my flesh
is an ocean
I carry with me
An ocean of potential
and the tension
between the boundless
and the boundary
quivers with life

Maybe one day
the boundary will fold
not in, but out
and devour this outer world
before it can devour me
Maybe this is where infinity comes from
layers of entities
each devouring the universe
and giving birth
to the space
we inhabit

I reach into the pool
and grasp a tiny fish
thrust from its world
it looks at me perplexed
as we devour each other
and our infinities meet
and merge
I realize
they were all a continuous space
and we are two faces
of the same vast entity
only now
seeing itself
for the first time
