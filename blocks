Large blocks of yellow froth
float by my head
my arm is huge, geometrical
and rotationally symmetric
I keep spinning it
but this just makes the timequakes stronger
Now the planets stack like brick pyramids
but this just means
the real action is several levels up
and I'm just playing my molecular role
but doing well at it
as a good molecule should
"Danger" shouts the ambient environment
but it's too late
to escape 
the rolling crushing spherelike invasion
as it lays waste to the orangey foam blocks
that make up so much of my world
I could adapt
but I've made my stake
Orangey foam feels nice
this sphereworld is a hazard
a suffocating unyieldingness
and there really is no place 
(but in between?????????)
