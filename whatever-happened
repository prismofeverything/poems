Whatever happened
to that moment
when the wind just started
and the photons kissed your neck
and you turned your head
as the bird flew by
Where is it now
because I can feel it
like it is right in front of me
throbbing like a vein
silent blood flowing smoothly
under the surface
Only the passage of time
is not real
because I am everywhere
with you
Right now
Every feather
of a single bird
