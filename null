In seeking the null poem
he found something worse
something that couldn't have necessarily been predicted beforehand
would be lurking there under the carpet of reality
watching and tense
waiting for a breach
to lash out mindlessly
upon all of creation
That sentient abhorrence
that flees rational thought
and eats
with all mouths at once
I saw blood
dripping from the stars
And we were surrounded by the howling
of the cosmos
So no, seeking the null poem was not a good idea
no matter how interesting the idea seemed at first
for in exploring that space
and before finding the sublime element
that lies at the center of all things
you must pass through dark mountains
and swamps of pure liquid evil
And a bridge that has no end
may we never fall
There is no escaping this poem
the inverse poem
bad
