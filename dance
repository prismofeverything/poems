I know where standing resumes
I know where you watch from
You know where we fall
You know how it unfolds there
I give everything meaning
like little coats
but you are a nudist
you want Chaos
and so do I
but I am too afraid
of unraveling
Where you travel
I sometimes follow
because I like to see
what you do there
It is a kind of dance
and I am starting to believe
in this god
You have five hundred hands
that stroke the fine face of the elephant
the Great elephant
whose blood gives all rivers life
I have no feet
but I fly
as long as I never land
I would like to dance sometime
when you are there
it could be considered
together?
And I'll spin you around
so that you forget
I don't exist
I'll hand you
more hands
and gather sunlight
in my palms
and we can drink them
on the great Rock
over the Sea
Forever
