A mild breeze
then snapping of a great tree limb
One tiny tone
then a rush of icy vacuum
Every world
exists in subtlety
Every subtlety
has eventually a severe impact
The eyes of a dragonfly
the fiery meteor of global destruction
Five toadstools in a ring
a third arm grows from every being
We know not the root of causation
but we have an idea
That connections make patterns
and no one is immune
I walk this path
and the world unfurls around me
I dance a step
and the universe is a liquid wholeness
I open my hand
and all of creation grasps back
