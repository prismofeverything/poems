In a little crumpled ball of nothingness 
(is this what something is?) 
there are two little lights 
one red one green 
that swirl around and around each other 
but never meet 
Sometimes it seems the red one chases the green 
other times the other way around 
sometimes perhaps they are totally unaware of each other 
The endless corridors of nothingness are inexhaustible 
and always more to explore 
Sometimes one will pulse, bright and green 
and the red one will pulse a little later 
Is this a conversation? Can they hear these pulses? 
But on they go 
around and around 
and I can't stop watching 
because it seems at any moment 
they will find each other 
And what could possibly happen then? 
Does the whole space collapse? 
Do they unite in an even more brilliant light? 
Do they pass right through each other? 
Are they doing that even now? 
I watch and watch 
and even though they come so close at times 
they never meet. And I don't know 
if it is because I am watching 
Perhaps they are together all the time 
except when I look? 
But then I am involved in this dance somehow
and I look within 
and see the lights dancing in there 
and where they meet 
A blinding flash
