A crowd of bees
covers every surface
Bees upon bees
until who even knows
what was ever down there?
Under the bees
is incomprehensible
there are so many
and digging down
to find out
seems unpleasant
Unwise
so we make our world here
among the bees
and don't really notice anymore
how many there are
and how everything
is made of them
and every glass of water
is nothing but bees
because these bees
give life
like water would
and my thirst
is quenched
and I breathe in
and out
a cloud of bees
and am content
every photon
a bee
drilling into me
giving a kind of soft warmth
It is a pleasant day
and everything has a kind of glow
or buzz
and I think how life is good
and how I am made of bees
as I drink bees
and become whole
