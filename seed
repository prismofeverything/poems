Over a hushed plain
the grasses wave
the whisper
of their windy god
A single tree
contorts itself
in a lifelong prayer
to rain and light
The cycle of brilliance
and shadow
pulses like a beating drum
as cell by cell
the tree pushes upwards
and outwards
straining with a patience
never exhausted
every blade of grass
a note in that great song
pushing forth
spreading, falling
then reborn
under its ever-widening arms
A flock of tiny birds
with flecks of red
alights for a moment
and does not even feel
the life flow up from their feet
the pulsing growth
that never ends
As they take off
a measure of the spirit
of that great tree
now fixed in their fabric
to spread among
fields never seen
whose new seeds take hold
and do not know
the great well of power
from whence they spring
