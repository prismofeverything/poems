I have walrus feet
they are always bumping into things
I shuffle about
and try not to hit them on things
But there are so many objects about
and these squalid, oversized feet
Just dangle
Protuberant
Visible under the water
I see a thousand tiny fish swimming around
picking at the funny creatures
embedded in my toes
Their tiny tongues
plucking microscopic
yet delicious
particles out of the water
At least these feet do some good here
as I relax at last
