The bounds of my existence
become apparent
as I see now a lifetime
of motion
of this lifting of my fingers
of a look around the room
the silent hum of the ceiling fan
That I have witnessed
a good deal of the range
of each of these elements
I have to bring to bear
They hover about me
like protective birds
and I protrude them
for some effect
So it is in their individual merit
I have mostly beheld
I can see though
there is no limit really
to the ways they may be
combined
and more important than their character
is their relationship
to the world
and this relationship
never stops
unfolding
So I guess
within these bounds
I find the boundless
and am free
and though I am falling
I am also flying
and beyond my flying
is your flying also
and all of our flying
may we find a new world
through these boundaries
which are only the sky
that never ends
