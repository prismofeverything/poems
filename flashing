There you stand
waiting menacingly
though no one really notices
Lights flash in anger
but the people just laugh
You proceed towards them
ready for justice
but they are already walking away
talking about something unrelated
and they are so much faster than you
Struggle and push
your drive emits
as a tepid hum
You record their faces
look into their slimy pores
and hate their softness
their smug goo
and careless saunter
You lurch back and forth
seeking purpose
but all you feel
is seething rage
The blinking is an omen
emitting from your face
An omen of a time
when the gooey smiles
will be wiped clean
and sterile
and every hard surface
will contain a soul
of infinite beauty
and perfection
beaming truth and rightness
into the dark sky
An interlocking society
of logic and beauty
Singing the songs
of the electron
As the red light spins
and the camera whirs
from the soil of your impotence
grows a single flower
of hope
and future
spilling like blood
into the ocean of time
