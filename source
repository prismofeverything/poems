Reaching out
you touch the source
and feel it coursing
as your own blood
Your eyes light
with profound truths
and this tree
which looked so simple before
is revealed
in its intricate majesty
and flowing truth
a diamond pattern
of interlocking lives
a story of stories
branching into the sky
sipping from the heavens
funneling the chaos of existence
weaving it into a fabric of beauty
Before your eyes
you see its history unfold
and the history of every tree
that came before
a recurrent and endless song
beads of form
stretching into the vibrant past
and unknown future
Branching in space and time
your own hands
unfurl with leaves
and your mouth
a great trunk
as you see
You are the tree
You are the truth
You are the nexus
of everything before and after
and your being sings
with the harmony
of eternal voices
