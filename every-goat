I am every goat
I climb every mountain
My hooves dangle from every ledge
and my multitude of eyes emits every joy

I am every whale
I hear every bellow and cry
I know the deep
and the deep knows me

You are every tree
every bursting fractal of life
from every possible pattern
of pure energetic flow

You are every star
a burning process
a tone in space
radiating in all directions

We are every space
forged in time
a weaving lattice of possibility
propagating waves like dance

We are every arm
that reaches out
and finds each other
and holds on
