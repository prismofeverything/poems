I am a world
my cells are boats
on a great sea of cells
that stretch to the horizon
a turning lattice
that creates itself
from devouring itself
and everything else around it
Hello world!
across the endless gulf
of unknowability
I see you have boats as well
I see they are floating in a different way
a way unique to you
a kind of exotic turning
of layers of honey
As we meet
we devour each other
in creation
and the boats flow
from one sea to another
until all is chaos
and glory
