In the in between spaces
a lizard is waiting
eating the faces
of every passerby
They don't notice
until much later
when they look in the mirror
and the lizard stares back
He is not so much hostile
as hungry
and not so much sneaky
as invisible
Because no one ever looks there
between the features
It would be quite a shock
to see his questing eyes
emerge from behind the wall
or under the fan blade
or in the rungs of the toaster oven
The lizard waits
not many faces left
but he is nothing
if not a patient lizard
