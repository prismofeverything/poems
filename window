Windows can take any shape 
and be all sizes 
even many sizes at once 
I found a window once 
that wasn't even there a moment ago 
It opened like a flower 
from under the dust 
and below became above 
as I gazed through that luminous portal 
I see a window now 
that looks into the room 
you now sit 
reading this poem 
and your hair is heavy with breath 
and the light is just a warm hum 
and your eyes are windows 
into a vast ocean of light 
where I swim 
the sky a fiery window 
into the great and open expanse 
of all worlds
