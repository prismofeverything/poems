Everything is a window
to everything else
an endless corridor
of mutual revealing
I reach into this crystalline mass
and pull out a future
One gleaming
and full of promise
It beholds me
like a small animal
curious and shy
and I behold it
and we reveal each other
and everything else
All up and down the network
of mutual seeing
a signal travels
uniting and combining
with every other signal
to create a web of song
so resonant and deep
that the whole world pulses
in harmony
A harmony
I am inseparable to
A harmony that reveals
its resonating elements
that in turn
reveal it back
and from this tone
rises an awareness
larger than the world
A gaze, benevolent and wise
cradles us, who are itself
and nowhere
is anything
lost
