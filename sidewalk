I know where the sidewalk ends
it ends in a little crumpled ball of dirt and grass
with a couple weathered wrappers
that have become part of the fabric of the earth itself
There is a small pile there
of broken, twisted bone
still a bit of gore strewn about
though the ants have found it by now
(you can track time by their progress)
This is what is left of a great dream
when they started, they thought the sidewalk would go on forever
Or rather, didn't think where it would go
but instead became absorbed in the building
The building of this sidewalk going nowhere
for no reason
for no value to anyone, except to occupy them while building
to be an incessant churning urgency
to fill the hollowness
left behind 
by the evisceration
of their existence into this bubble
that popped (of course)
and left them strewn here
an acre of gore 
out across the projection
of where the sidewalk would have continued
It stretches back
cutting a red, violent line through history
that festers even now
A sidewalk
that only ghosts walk on
At least it ends
and we have peace
for a moment
