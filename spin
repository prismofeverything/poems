One day
spinning in a circle
and every petal rising
One spin
our mouths open
to the sky
the next
Our hands
like lava
Where do we forget
the things
they sink
and dissolve
but the network remembers
and integrates these lost children
into its bones
where they gain power
and emit sounds
and light
and howling mouths
and the power
Flows
through their icy fingers
Lightning
living like a tree
with Roots
and Growing
into a substrate
of Thriving life
