The mass of the world
looks into my heart
and what multiplies there
defies imagining
A bubbling emergence
of flowering pain
and beauty
Every light beam
bound in a loop
creating eyes
that spill forth
in furious energy
The nascent awarenesses
spiral into a tower
that is lost in the sky
a tower of mouths
and babbling
The modulation
of every color block
accelerates into a blur
And finally from the core
the activity fuses
into the sleeping eyes
of an eternal and tranquil soul
forever dreaming
of swaying grass
in an open field
