I stand upon the bubbling ice
gazing down into the depths
where the flowing has ceased
but lies dormant
waiting to spring
I love the way the truth
shines through these different phases
that the water still flows in the ice
and the river is stable like a stone
cutting into the earth
and showing us its heart
bleeding onto the surface
Now plasma rises
searing away the leaves
and my tiny frame
a single vertical line
still walks among the forests
sublimated to ash
And then I am below the surface
fish swimming around my head
curious about my eyes
which cry in joy
at the vibrancy of all things
Maybe this moment
frozen for all time
will last beyond me
as I am claimed by the current
and transformed yet again
Maybe they are all still there
and we all get to do this
forever
