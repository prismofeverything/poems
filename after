It is after the world
the pools are dry
forgotten stasis
collects in small islands
unmoving
The sun still shines here
but its rays are oddly
blank
as they fall
on these quiet obelisks
The bustling activity
feels just out of reach
like you turn your head
and it had just evaporated
its stillness still charged
with motion
It is as if
you are out of phase
Present, but shifted
so that all the action
lies hidden behind
a membrane of time
Time flows laminar
then disrupts, tumbling everywhere
Your arm goes down one path
your face another
You feel the drift
as an indistinguishable absence
like the humans
who once lived in this place
Who once had dreams
and these dreams are still here
even though the humans have vanished
The dreams float
a hovering presence
durable, saturating
I don't want to disturb them
with my passage
while they still sleep
so we rest here
and our dreams
merge
streaks of bright paint
flowing downstream
