This
  pain
this
   level
this
    opening
I see down the
     waterfall
into my hands
      spilling
hands
a fall
of hands
upon hands 
upon hand hands

Now we can find the purpose
of hands
as they scurry
across the world
causing change
changing each mote
changing it
then changing again
a universe of microscopic puppets
tracked
and orchestrated
by infinite hands
spilling into the cosmos
from my sharp
invincible beak
