Proton
folds gently
into a glowing sheet
upon the infinite grid
each vertex
a glyph
containing a message

Far off
the grid is being devoured
and tumbles into a singularity
and a sea of mouths
grin hungrily
at the order
The blood of orthogonality
is bright
and pure
a subtle sweetness
that saturates these beings
splattered on every surface
great arcs of violence
among torn membranes

Beyond the circular halo
hovering guardian of the sky
the vertexes multiply
like foliage
expressing their pattern
upon themselves endlessly
a spilling fluid
of form
until it becomes
a forged continuity
of circulation
and being
