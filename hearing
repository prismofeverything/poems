The sky is an ear
that funnels us up
into its waiting cavern
lined with hairs
of orbits
and until we are heard
(which sounds like a form of destruction
as the great membrane
samples us)
Until we are heard
I still have time
to tell you
I hear you
I hear your heart
I hear your quavering beam
of light
that yearns for the cool taste
of understanding
someone to hear it
I don't know what monster
lies at the top of the sky
who will hear us both
as tiny sounds
May it awake?
Maybe it has been waiting
this whole time?
Maybe it will hear us
and know for the first time
its purpose
My hair pulls upwards
(along with my feet)
and tangles with yours
and I see the hairs
on your face
long to be heard
as the tears from your eyes
stretch upwards
with mine
May the hearing resound
may the tones be pure
and true
May we all hear ourselves
being heard
at last
