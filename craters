An erupting fountain
of harm
the size of craters
where craters have no size
where the edge of each crater
is itself a crater
and every crater
an edge
of countless others
I grow
(feeding on pain
on blinding light
I call fire)
to take over the sky
and rain
soft life-giving water
over the thriving landscape
