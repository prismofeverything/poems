I have the worlds
but by having
they are lost

I am with the worlds
and we eye each other
breathing
heavily

I commune in the space the worlds inhabit
and we hum together
finding a peace
and a sign
pointing west

The world and I and we and everything
comes together at a single point
that progresses
unfurling
continuously molting
a series of shedding insect bodies
marking the progression of time
each a world
not unlike our own
faces we recognize
and a place, inhuman
beyond human
where our eyes reside

I am a point
that is the world

The world comes flooding like a torrent
everyone I love is there
shouting and flailing
and it floods past, the tears and ruin
and shards of joy
and I laugh
and cry
as we are swept
away

I

the world

We are there
Now
