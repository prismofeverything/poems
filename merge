The wind is whipping by my face
but I don't see it
my gaze is fixed
on the snowy mouth
of this impossible cavern
Ages I've trudged
gaining a layer of snow armor
until I can barely move
but I see a light
flickering there
calling me forward
showing me that warmth
can still exist
It is an empty world
once so full
And only one star
in the vortex sky
One star of blackness
swallowing the cosmos
I move forward
I don't know how
my ragged breath furling and unfurling
as my hand multiplies in fingers
each longer and bluer than the last
A threshold
between wasteland and warmth
and every memory
of a lost world
sublimates in dancing vapor
as molecule by molecule
I am unwoven
and merge
with the light
