A vast sheet
of rain
approaches us
Its shattering force
a bounty of life
and transformation
You live here
but here is changing
every day
The light passes
tiny fragments of wings
glowing then shadow
a meandering trail
over the bobbing grass entities
that populate this hillside
We multiply here
until there are many of us
enjoying the company
of our own selves
and the beds of moss
wrap around us
even in death
which is just
a brief prelude
to a rich organic layering
of new life
upon life
upon life
The rain reaches us
and we open our arms
as every molecule 
dissolves
and reforms
into a new pattern
of our making
