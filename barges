I go floating
on Jupiter air
thick and turgid
silicon swirls
grains dry and hard
My hand
passes through them
but they form again
behind it
The flashes
of the barges
dangling like figs
in that sharded sky
We will find the passage
to where you lay
a sleeping
and beautiful
giant
We have so many questions
that only you can answer
The barges have
so many eyes
A tangle of ropes
descends into the black ink
and we go falling
in search of you
and one day
we'll find you
And the world
can be opened
again
