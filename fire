The fire of life is burning
deep in my belly
I feel it struggle
and desire
I feel it hunger
to claw at the world
and find purchase
Its insatiable maw
drooling fire
Can we do anything
but live
until we can't anymore?
And who am I?
this funny point of intervention
that includes a sliver of empathy
in this smoldering mass
of cravings and blood
That is able to reflect
and reason with the beast
to spike its fire
with a cool streak of calmness
To find balance
in something that is always fighting
for more
We reckon with each other
and recognize our dependency
and inseparability
and these two perspectives merge
into an open awareness
of unbounded space
