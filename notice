Sometimes you notice something
that was there all along
a detail, obscured in plain view
perpetuating through time
though never notice
A nodule beyond perception
containing all of reality
When you actually see it
it comes striking through the intervening space
a shocking pulse of recognition
its twisting internals morphing as you look
swallowing itself in a churning roll
and you hear its voice
screaming in an inaudible frequency
all of the texture of suffering, and creation
You reach your hand in
slowly
and it catches suddenly
pulling you in
and you see your own internals open
and cycle through a streaming ouroboros
a soft glow
that no one ever notices
