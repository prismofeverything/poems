Between two, there is one
a thin and ephemeral line
that contains all life
We sink in the gelatin
of time
and are frozen there
our limbs articulated
as if in gesture
describing the paradox
And that very paradox
keeps the scene spinning
and the limbs flailing
and the unity unfolding
Between one, there is two
each an essential element
of this liquid collective
They reach
and find each other
giving meaning to their seeking
each a fulfillment of what the other cannot provide
A tiny seed
where the unity grows
fed by birds
from down the funnel
of the paradox
that gives us life
