Everywhere we see it
great streaks of smearing feces
covering the walls

I know you can't escape it
Destroy the organ
it taunts you

Places falling like lava shower
we drain there
a pile of eyes

Why do we hover?
I long for the ground
it is so far off

I remember a time
when there were no animals
it was very sad
and empty

Now when you hear
a far off calling
the voice of many birds
creating their world
deep underground
boring with power
to the center of the earth
to the magma center
that eats spacetime
