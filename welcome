The manic bird
warbles its manic cry
attentive in any response
made tense
by the silence
Every soft thing
falls downward
and I collect them
here
for you
to appreciate
long after
this stream
has flowed onward
I assemble them
into circles
and each one
lights up
in anticipation
of your long distant
arrival
from other planets
Welcome
from the past
