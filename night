When you went walking
one night
and the breeze
was immediate
and you knew something was profound
about it
though doubted yourself
because you could not articulate
what about this evening
which contained no spectacular details
was nonetheless significant
even though no one else realized
as they were walking along
cosmic paths
guided by forces
created long before 
they ever took form
every aspect 
reached out to you
a million tiny hands
made of stars
and reached in glee
at the reality of it all
And you knew
like the sky knew
that you were a part
of everything
that was happening
and had ever happened
and would ever happen
and in that moment
you were doing
exactly
what you were supposed to be
doing
Looking
realizing
awareness a thousand springtimes
a blanket of flowers
of perception
and the benevolent
and infinitely caring arms
of the trees
encircling you
as they always had
and every star
a burning conspiracy
of joy
erupting in your mind
and you know
You are this world
this whole world
and your eyes are the eyes
of every being
and we see
and suffer
as One
