One day
all of the wings
will come unfurling
forth
and the fountains
will sing
with bursting
and spilling
a rainbow of life
and the tiny monkeys
that carry the flowers
will be feeding each other dates
and laughing at us
Maybe then
the terrible eye
will finally close
for a moment
and we can take
a breath
before the whirlpool
consumes the world
