There is a place between words
where all the things I want to say are
The words forming a black lattice
while dance around it the living spirits
Can we follow these small animals
into their experience?
Weaving through the fibers
there is every manner of form here
interlocking in a dynamic mesh
that forms around its need
I give intention
and intention gives me
Really we give each other
and in the process
we are given
Just like the world
and the words curl around this meaning
and point towards
the true form
which is always
there anyway
