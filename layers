Life is a layer
where every layer
is a dance
And every layer
some new wonder
forms itself
out of the dancing
below
I am dancing too
because I am a form
of joy
in seeing
how I dance
for the same reason
everything else is dancing
Because we choose
and that choice
is a dance
that merges with all the other dancing
on every layer
and becomes
Everything
dancing
in recognition
of everything
Dancing
this now stretching
becoming history
writing a line of motion
and energy
the brush
of eternity
And history
is what is left behind
when the dancing
has passed
now dancing
in another now
Don't get lost
Come with us
Keep dancing
until we can't dance
anymore
until the wheels fall off
And the legs buckle
and the ceiling crumbles
and the ocean seeps
onto the land
And we lay
panting and exhausted
as we dissolve
into smaller dances
that spiral off
to new beginnings
