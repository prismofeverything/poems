An animal gazes
side to side
Its great tongue
a palette of deep color
leaking paint
into the surrounding world
We recline
and open our bellies
sinking into the deeper layers
Layer upon layer
each membrane breaking
without resistance
We build with absences
and our creations sing
with the energy
of nothingness
Its knowing eyes
melt into my brain
through my eyes
and it sees everything
I think
and it tastes
my thoughts
and licks their stamens
a strange honey
we share this joy
as I fall backwards
through barely distinguishable
layers
This world
unfolds here
and all potential
spills in a great waterfall
over the rocky face
broken
then reformed
My great stride pulses
as the open minds
offer their nectar
blooming
in soft wind
