I look back on the tiny island
that now grows wings
I'm on that island
and I'm also watching it take flight
from the warm sea it called home
for so many countless eons
the dripping water makes ripples
in the departing surface below
and an elation that keeps rising
along with the funny little mote of land
that was never really land at all
but a cocoon
for a new world
in the sky
