The dark roiling of the world
turns underneath
I see the hands of long lost souls
grasping for the air
as if there were some purchase there
that could possibly free them
from this swirling well
An inexorable pull
draws them burbling down
into the unknowable depths
The molten stream of pain
flows heavy
streaming haphazardly upon this writhing mass
seeping down the layers
a thick brine
of flesh and metal
In all this
I hear a tone
soft at first
then rising in clarity
A song
like the whispering of many snails
bright wisps of light
in the tormented darkness
It's always been there
only my ears are better now
They form a voice
quiet with faraway wonder
that intones a message
no one hears
