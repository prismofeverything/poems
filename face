A grey field
three green spots
blooming in red
The great face
bellows from the sky
and rains down
a stream of dark birds
each one
the voice of god
We know
within your heart
lives a universe
of thriving planets
And on those planets
we live through generations
of life and loss
Each tragedy
a world
Each blade of grass
a path
This silent edge
scythes through
the air gelatin
holding these elements
in a slumbering stasis
and releases them
furiously
upon the red field
four grey spots
bleeding green acid
into our eyes
to see finally
our own bellowing face
of fleeing birds
