Becoming
yourself
every moment
giving birth
to the next
I am carried
forward
and the walls of impossibility
close around me
The speed of light
towards the future
down an unrelenting slope
careening into oblivion
You look around
and see the blur
of passing by
each tree
blinding network
This hurtling journey
an awareness
and deep calm
clods of earth
falling around you
You know
why you find
meaning
strands of raw creation
braiding around your head
in every color
May you find a path
that makes hurtling
a celebration
