Descending
the depths
of the liquid pool
of dreams
it becomes light again
after the darkest strata
and glows brighter
as you fall
This light
emerges from a simple
cone
of possibility
Where the curvature of thought
converges
I believe
and the tendrils snake out
a mandala
over the stone wall
which creates
a strange barrier of access
where every path leading in
deflects
and this deflection
Glows
