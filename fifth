The water churned
like a thousand hands wrestling
the vividness a striking aqua, blinding vision
we sneak into the passage
between the rocks
a small patch of sand smooth and unmarked
an inviting cove
nestled by this relentless intensity
Four elements distinct
Sky, Water, Rock, Sand
and then suddenly they collide
and the sand rises
water is everywhere
This hidden cove a roiling sea
and now we are the fifth element
the living vibrant flesh
surrounded by Rock
swallowed by Water
the Sand seeping in every crease
all wrapped in Sky
before our arrival, incomplete
Now united in fullness
a cipher of truth
our configuration a fulfillment
of long-ago embarked upon paths
a unique convergence
and even now unfolding
along a new trajectory
