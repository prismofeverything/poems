The moth hovers
above the world
speaking tongues
no one knows
It radiates
a hyper calm
blinding tranquility
liquid awareness
a rotating equator
of seeing
The moth knows
in an alien way
pure and immediate
and it cascades down
upon the world
in sheets
Shattering sky
its wings pulsate
in a vast beating
and its voice
though gentle
annihilates towers
in its shrieking pitch
It is unendurable
yet we endure
upon the land
blighted by the Moth
the land
given by the Moth
we live our lives
sometimes casting upwards
and witnessing
without withstanding
plastered to the oil earth
a gaping face
witnessing
the hovering transcendent
Moth
above
