Gardens of stone
grow slowly
and in geometry
patient layers
and electric dust
padding by
are creatures
with snouts
of squishy foam
that lap
at the small puddles
that bud off
the rocks
each one a mind
each puddle a thought
that sublimes
as it's tasted
Underneath
the tectonics wait
in a kind of 
timeless
slumber
and everyone knows
the geometry
is everywhere
we are made of it
it sticks to our clothing
and hands
as we try to wave it away
trailing along
a gelatinous absence
but we merge back
and become what 
we know
an island
we grasp onto
while the waters 
pummel
the shell
