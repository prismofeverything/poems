Madrigal
spreading through the valley
a fluid of tones
deep green sink
seeping gently invasive
and what we happened
to hear
I trust
that hearing
and the blade
that keeps hearing
Every bird follows this stream
and drinks from the fountain
We are just seeing
for the first time
a world
that gives us
ourselves
and I look into this gift
a ball of light
blinds me
and shows me the answer
We are the limitation
and we are the power
My eyes pass cosmic rays
and become a mind
