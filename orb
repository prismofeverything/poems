I have an orb
I cradle it in my hands
I carry it with me everywhere
sometimes it is quite heavy
I place the orb on a stand each night
and lay down to sleep
The orb glows ominously above me
projecting shadows about the room
I wake, and the orb wakes with me
seeking sustenance
I cradle the orb
and set out
This orb weighs more every day
and its growling is audible now
I fear to think
of the release
losing it would entail
and instead
clutch it tighter
against me
