Some days
the world closes in
and surrounds me
with the cries 
of the suffering 
Where did you suffer
that no one ever saw?
What life 
was stolen 
by the haphazard flow
of rock?
I reach out 
and silence greets me
Silent
like the time 
you broke 
When everything you loved 
was swept away 
I bow my head 
for you 
and all the others 
that never had a voice 
for how the pain 
happened to blossom 
a flower 
no one wanted 
but became
Everything 
The tears 
stream
and overflow
the rivers of Earth
and every bank
swells with loss
I see you there
and I break with you
May you know one day
you were not 
alone 
forever
