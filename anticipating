It expands lightly
quivering
an anticipating surface
anticipating itself
as it reaches
touching
for the first time
a metal surface
that clings
Here in the field
we coil around each other
laughing as the flowers
erupt out of our mouths
and our eyes
become hives
of honey
and wings
And that awareness
a sudden recoil
a flash
an eye
made of flesh
a surface of seeing life
uncertain
and curious
as the hum of wings
emerges behind it
