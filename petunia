The petunia juts
obscenely into the walkway
children howl in confusion
dogs bark
A whole host of
the vaguely religious
sways and mutters under their breath
before the offending bloom
It drips ichor
thick and black
like honey
undeflected onto the ground
where it accumulates
in a fetid pile
of repulsive fleshy pleasure
quivering like meat
taunting the onlookers
into passion
Another wail goes up
and finally the authorities arrive
clad in solid angles
They stand before the petals
smirking half in bravado
half in fear
Tentatively
One reaches out his hand
but it erupts into color
and a radiating joy
emanates from his digits
rising like fire
And the blinding sparks
swirl up
and fall back to the earth
some distance away
as seeds
quietly unfurling
