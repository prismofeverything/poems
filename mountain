You reach the mountain
but what was it
you were striving for?
Is it even here?
The bitter wind
a hideous taunt
You think slowly back
to warm fires
the soft pulsation of talk
pads of warm felt
against the lull of night
A tiny cat
pausing against your leg
the fur trailing fire
the seeds rising
transcendent
into the air
And that great tree
where you would eat
soft mangoes
with a faceless love
These are lost now
no more than flickers in your mind
tiny sparks
against this world of pain
but you see now
the pain
is the point
carving your soul
into a feathered mandala
of energy and truth
The world recombines
and here is where
eternity lives
You are in it
if you can see
with the rest
of your eyes
