The world is inside out
I hover here in the center
at the point where gravity cancels
and look out at the impenetrable shell
of landscapes below me
and above me
and anywhere I look
Mountains and rivers
forests and deserts
Every imaginable form
a living tapestry
writhing and pulsing
with the passage of time
I wonder how it is illuminated
then I remember I am the Sun
which is why I might be so warm
and lonely
out here
I think sometimes about breaking through that wall
(some day)
but I quail at the loss
and damage I would create
And really have no idea
what I would find out there
In the meantime I burn
and the world lives
and loves
And maybe that
is enough
