The birds take flight
and scatter across the world
of dreams
The great tree of plasma
rises beyond the sky
home to several
who drink their fill
glowing ichor streaming down their breast
The whirlpool of eyeballs
seems to never complete
its incessant devouring
of so many elements of sight
(where are all these sightless beings?
or do they still see
as their eyes are drawn downwards
into darkness?)
Endless stretches of desert
full of eight headed beetles
sand in rainbow streaks
bleeding into the waste
they fly over, never tiring
A tower where
the staircase rises while falling
And falls while ascending
and remakes itself upon each step
the intricate networks of symbols and runes
that describe the essence of the universe
They perch upon the very top
seeking all knowing
and finding only omniscience
A small flock descends
into the bowels of the churning light
that lives at the center
of this strange inside out world
where thought becomes reality
and reality becomes itself
over and over again
The spinning core
emits tendrils of knowing
that touches every aspect of this transformation
and each bird
sups at its periphery
as much as it dares
The chiming of a far off bell
calls to each, flung across space
and their cawing flight
turns its great purpose
back to the source
of all things
From every corner
of this non-orthogonal aspect
comes a tearing path of return
that cuts into the fabric of this world
forging new rivers of blood
indiscriminately across its mournful face
As they converge again
in the place where all paths unite
a blinding flash awakes them
and they are one
They are you
Awake
