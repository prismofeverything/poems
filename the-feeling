The feeling brooded, emanating
thoughts clouding around like bats
flapping their wings asymmetrically
A zap of lightning
the thoughts combined
and enshrouded the feeling mass
in a layer of electricity
molding it, forming it
transmuting its internal geometries
A pulsation issues forth
billowing clouds of vapor
now its many legs
start rambling about the room
the onlookers just gaze
knowing
as the feeling collides with the walls
A system of copper fibers
intricately sensitive
breathes to life under this new activity
A swirling pillar
spitting winged horses
spitting eyes
spitting legs and neighing
And the whole world spins there
with this lone feeling as its fulcrum
the invisible fibers a net
as the liquid plasma seeps through the network
feeding their faces
giving life to all the forms
that control it
