Magic is a thing
like a rock
You can hold it
as it pulses
through your finger bones
channels of power
ancient like the faces
in the trees
Magic is why
everything spins
and the great masses
keep flowing
into themselves
Magic stands
on the precipice
of a great waterfall
and emits howling
islands
into the sky
To float majestically
giving life and foundation
to so many animals and trees
Native evolution
diverges in each subecosystem
until spilling forth
a fountain of diversity and splendor
A phoenix, a wombat crab
Butterfly cats in swarms
grasses spilling to the earth far below
which is also Magic
and really
Everything is Magic
and Everything is this Rock
