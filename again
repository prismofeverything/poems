Something begins
a tiny howl
the thread of a sprouted seed
twisting into the sky
and its blind head
reaches
into the emptiness
where a thousand mouths
wait silenty
We all trust
what we cannot see
and neglect
what is right in front of us
This massive strata
and endless field
of interlocking patterns
just chose to unfurl
and the channels of energy
drip into the earth
a glowing sap
hissing as it melts
the soil away
into a battery
mountain range
of melting
And we all sing
the melting
We melt
to be forged
Again
