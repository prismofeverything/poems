The dawn spreads like hands
of a great bird
lifting the earth
in its talons
and the dark blanket
of mist
flees the glaring fire
of a world newly lit
This time the world is vibrant green
and full of dew
The next it is a grey wasteland
with clouds of dust
Now it is an endless sea of singularity blue
and then a field of geometric pillars
It shifts through every form
undulating mass
crystallizing in motion
and spilling into the next possibility
My eyes are open
each one a world
each one a tragedy
each one a thrilling note of hope
as I embrace my changing world
and hold on
