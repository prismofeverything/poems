What happened
to the world?
It was just snowing
with ballerinas
and now all this gore
Let's start again
but this one too
is a massacre
Perhaps we will make them turtles
Turtle people
of peace
Wait, why are they
murdering each other?
I want life
to operate
according to certain principles
of justice
and beauty
but it is just rioting
and chaos
and doesn't seem to care
about all the blood
strewn across
the naked hills
Yet here
in one corner
lies a sleeping lamb
Knowing no malice
it sleeps
and dreams
of destruction
