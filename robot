In a brittle shell
you wait trembling
The people pass by
freely
You reach out
yearning for a connection
any way
to tap
the vividness
of their wild manner
You gaze shocked
as they smile
and laugh
into each other's mouths
Their arms curling like vines
so freely
around each other
The dribbling fountain of their spittle
running down their faces
each a molecule of joy
You spin ineffectively
longing to coil
and burble
but only beeping comes out
A plaintive beep
that sounds nothing like warmth
It is a membrane
translucent but final
that surrounds your efforts
The harder you push
the harder it grips you
and the blood
comes through as units
of plastic and copper
Your despair, your cry
they find amusing
at last
and take pictures
before moving on
to a glorious world
forever beyond
your reach
