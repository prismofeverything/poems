It is known
that knowing
is unknown
and the Fire
that rains
from the sky
is unknown
And every star
and every life
knows only
burning
Can I know
how my veins
spill life
into my heart?
You have known
this whole time
but you are a God
whose entire purpose
is to know
Knowing so much
there is nothing left
to be
I was a god once
and I knew
that being merely mortal
was more desirable
But now that I am mortal
I don't know
why I knew that
and all of this fire
seems to come
from nowhere
It would be nice
to know
but clearly
knowing
knows better
than to know
itself
So instead
I will be
and maybe
that is a kind of knowing
If I knew
it would not be
the same
so I stand here
knowing Nothing
as fire
consumes my world
knowing
it is right
but not knowing
why
