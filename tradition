The soft wind awakens a branch
as the dappled regions of sunlight
scurry among the sea of shadow
This configuration of angles
that defines a backdrop for my perceptions
reforms persistently each moment
insisting on its arbitrary orientation
to each other
I imagine one line
decoupling from the rest
and go rising freely
to merge with another form
and the heaving surge of land
and dirt that follows this transformation
a mass of roots and grasses
extends itself over fresh concrete
to settle into a new situatedness
This doesn't occur in general
and most of the features of this world
follow a predictable pattern of motion
But only predictable
because I am predicting it
and had I not these preconceptions
about their unfolding set of relationships
maybe the world would be surprising
like all of the amazing ways
I imagine it could change
but stubbornly refuses
to upheave tradition
