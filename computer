A computer is a beast
that devours souls
like pumpkin seeds
The vibrant life gathers
around the shiny metallic shell
full of sharp lights and mystery
and immediately
the evisceration begins
The machine sits there
glutting itself on life blood
as the souls keep flooding in
Their eyes grow wide
as they realize they are falling
over the precipice
But with wonder
or fear?
It is unknown
It would be sensible to fear
but no sensible things remain
The machine has stripped them
with perverse pleasure
into candy colored sensations
that only resemble true feelings
This substitution occurs
over and over again
until the whole world
is a sea of sharp lights
blinking on and off
And the souls
have all been absorbed
into its insatiable maw
that, lacking new victims
turns next onto the substrate
of reality itself
