Here in the bottom of the well
I see a small form scurry by
its glistening segments flash as they spin by
I hear tiny sounds
the drip of water
the clicking of tiny legs
the songs of all the blind dank bugs that live in the walls
It is soft at first
but their chorus rises to the greatest heights
and washes me in a warmth
that pushes out the bitter cold
and endless damp
I look up
like I do once a day
and see the tiny orb of the sky
twinkling above me
So real, and persistent
yet unattainable.
Today, instead of a single unbroken orb
there are forms up there
flickering like candles
a hurried activity
that I cannot comprehend at all
I shut my eyes for a moment
then awake to a chaos of sound
I later identify as shouting
(it has been so long)
I see now there are several figures
rappelling down the long vertical tube
that leads to my hideout
I wail in surprise
and try to dig
but they have me
I'm being rescued
which means it will be weeks
before I'm able to get back down here
I say goodbye
to the tiny voices
and my tears merge
with the ceaseless boundless surface below.
