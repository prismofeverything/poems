A brief arrow
lights into the sky
It aims at god
but they do not appear
Instead it reaches, reaches
but the sky is larger
by far
and momenta by momenta
the arrow's flight falters
and there is a brief moment
when the arrow is poised
neither rising nor falling
but still reaching
This moment seems to continue
perpetually
Time
frozen
but then we see
the world is still spinning on
around it
There are still birds
and gears
and the clicking of heels
and the rustling of trees
Life continues
but the arrow remains
poised
neither continuing its ascent
to the divine
nor falling back
to the festering earth
I hear it is still there
seeking truth
but finding instead
Purpose
