I am an egg
a protein yolk
suspended in time
the unfolding is the point
my blind eyes
see worlds
that will not yet be
my folded hands
await a purpose
the entire strata
my context
pulsating with a dormant cycle
The world outside
a
blur
of motion
a kaleidoscope of form
and color
and fire
and mouths gaping
Feeding continues
as I hover there
a prism of becoming
yolk progressively transmuted
into being
through osmosis
I create myself
drawing in
the ambient nutritive potential
channeling it into eyes
and flesh
So many eyes
and there in the shell
a flaw begins
a crack in time
the insulation
of my perfect containment
finally rupturing
and releasing
the world
in a rush
of light
