This whole invincible kaleidoscope
spins on
unfurling a tapestry of wonders
A parade of celestial elephants
and octopod inversects
We're all on there somewhere
clutching with white knuckles
at the meager handholds
But we also sing
and struggle
to join
Sometimes we go hurtling off
with a fading echo
into the surrounding ambience
which is not known
but seems to pervade
and ultimately to accept
like a loving mother
a wayward child
returned home
