Through the wavering sheet
of plasma air
I see your face
reflected a thousand times
I reach out
but my arms evaporate
in that unforgiving heat
My reaching continues
though no corporeal structure remains
Structure is obsolete
and now I zip between the wavefronts
spread as a fluid through every crevice of space
Yet a barrier remains
I pool flatly
at the surface of that great wall
no pore or surface
through that great plane
that cuts through an entire axis
of reality
But still your face
Now thousands upon thousands
of tiny suns
and a vast echo
crosses that membrane
and speaks into my ear
(which is now all of me)
"hello"
