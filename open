I am in the open
there is nothing around me
but grass
and whistling
I anticipate some arrival
I look from side to side
But nothing appears
I stoop down and fan
my fingers in this grass
It is cool
and soft
A subtle presence
and I realize it is the grass
that has arrived
Is arriving
A thousand beings
beckoning forth
a thunderous roar
and I startle
and stumble backwards
But it is
too late
The whole situation
Has closed
Like a world sized venus flytrap
And I can only think
how much
I've always liked the grass
still kind of like it
(as it slowly digests me)
