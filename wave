A vast wave
comes hurtling towards the village
scurrying in every direction
a woman and a plant
three children
a herd of geese
The houses themselves
are nervous
and tense
As it approaches
we see
the wave is made of glass
and has not moved
for many years
The slow crystalline surface
flowing patiently
over millenia
The children too
are frozen smiling
The wave is time
the village is time
We are all time
Beings made of time
like dripping beads of glass
bending light
in its own prism
declaring softly
our existence
before the wave
of infinity
crashes over us
