The birds fly in circles
over the great tower
its ivory spires
slicing the belly of the sky
Their cries echo
as a single mass
and their feathers merge
into a whirlwind of eyes
From all sides
the smoke rises
and an occasional flash
tears through the world
and the cries of the birds
rise in warbling pitch
a chaos of voices
a liquid mass of sound
and the tower lifts
like a rocket
and they all go streaming into the sky
in a tornado of feathers
and masonry
stone shards tumbling to the earth
whose wasted alleys
have no more pain
to give
