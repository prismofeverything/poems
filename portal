I peer down the length of the portal
and see a kaleidoscope of realities
turning impossibly
A flock of sheep
bray in the wind
Three figures in suits bruskly pass
An entire jungle, a thin liquid line of river
birds casting into the sky
A circle of dancing
the squailing of monkeys
A child does a somersault from one side to the other
I wade in
not looking to the side
where every manner of existence
plays forth
inviting
repulsing
I forge onward
ignoring the lion
look ever inward
adhering to the center
I move my head
and see the portal waver
the long snake of its tunnel
winding around itself
There are cannons and dark clouds of soot to the left
and daisies on a sunny hillside to the right
A waterfall, then three giraffes
this platform leads through it all
A straight glowing axis
The hot air balloon comes out of nowhere
and as it collides I grasp upon it
and am swept quickly away
and Up
I am tininess flailing
scrambling over the side
panting with sudden exertion
I look into the faces of my companions
and already cede the realities
falling away below me
