A single mote of dust
lies on the unbroken surface
What did it once belong to?
A flower, now reduced to ashes?
The tip of an ear, now merged with the dirt?
Is it the eyelash of a tiny creature,
long traveled to distant lands?
There is a significance in the smallest things
as we are made of so many
and our large monster world
could not exist without them
Beyond that, in the tiniest object
lies the secrets of the universe
and all of creation is bundled in there
vibrant and ready to be touched
accessed, embirthed and revealed
I approach the tiny mote
and as I draw near, it glows
With inspection, I see it contains the entire world
and there I am, looking back up at me
with the most curious expression
I wave, and I wave back
How did this unbroken surface
get in this mote of dust?
I turn back, and the giant eye considers me
