A low rumbling
imperceptible
traverses the earth
It is a voice
that we can't hear
It is a tone
that has been ringing
for five eternities
The cry is sincere
we are each a mote
of that great Ear
which even now
rings with the message
I cry out in sudden
realization
and that cry
echoes through
these mosaic halls
detailing the planting
and growing
of our new world
These nested realizations
go on forever
at every scale
above and below
so that this tone
harmonizes across time
and unites
in a sudden fury
An outburst
of alignment
Like all the hands of time
linking at last
All eyes
superimposing
the constellations
of timeless planets
And we all see
at once
each other
which is everything
