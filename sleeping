A fire brews
its turgid wine
and spills it forth
upon the earth
a cackling pack
of patchy beings
roll back and forth
in burning potency
crying out
to a liquid sky
a lifetime sensorium
of inner pain
The ground is a thin layer
and just below
the dripping falls
on the blind denizens
of the endless tunnels
and they howl in glee
spitting blood
a chorus of dark thickness
spreading over the matted hair
of the great being
that even now slumbers
and whose dreams
revel now
in this transitory glee
above and below
the surface of
its sleeping mind
