Somewhere deep in my soul
lies a dark fragment
glinting and full of blood
While the spirit thrives around it
it pierces that joy from time to time
with a sharp stab
reminding me that the world has edges
and this flesh is soft
I reach in slowly
through the opening in my belly button
where I am connected back to my mother
and hers beyond that
My fingers achieve purchase
on the sliver of pain
and I pull
ignoring the slicing
and extract it whole
In the sunlight, it is a little dull
and maybe not so threatening
As I look at it, it seems to transform
into a smiling face
and here we are smiling at each other
and our blood is one thing
