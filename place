A place in the world
where the goats gather
where every quiet animal
comes to pay homage
and every rabbit
bows its head
as space flows
from its eyes

In this place
lie seven tablets
arrayed in a sphere
Each one a letter
meaning everything
in a different way

We all mean everything

I scratch this goat's chin
and it gazes
into me
giving me a gift
of patience
and knowing
beyond words

The singing never started
and it never stopped

Where do we find ourselves?
if not in the finding
Where do we go?
if not everywhere
all the time

I'm here
You're here
The goats are here
They're scratching your chin
and taking
your pain
as space flows
all around you
