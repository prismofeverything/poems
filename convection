Here in the sun
heat is an abstraction
the burning has burned away burning
and only truth remains
The truth of plasma
and convection
the flow of all things
plays out its inexorable river
under and through itself
These channels have a purpose
that transcends time
They seek a balance
and in seeking, create meaning
through the mutual travel of forces
a solution is reached
A living molten solution
that unites every magmic stream
in a timeless dance
of boundless emission
