This mechanical arm
comes looming from the periphery
aggressively clutching
at the chickens
who cluck in panic
Luckily it is clumsy
and blind
and we huddle over in the corner
It gesticulates so wildly
with such profusion
that we laugh a little
Then the spray of blood
as it finds purchase
The squawking intensifies
as we are blasted with plump matter
I think on life
how something so beautiful
could be perverted into this
horror
The merry-go-round spins up
lights blaring, klaxons singing
and we are spattered again
I don't even hear the screaming
I am transfixed
by a tiny shaft of light
that flickers as debris flies through space
but never yields
I follow its path, looking up
to a tiny aperture
and climb the light beam
like a golden staircase
ignoring the chaos around me
and emerge into that blinding reality
and as I wither into nothingness
under the harsh blast of plasma heat
I smile
and am happy
for the first time
