I hide under this leaf
great sounds crashing around me
this one sounds like blood
another bellowing howl
I shake here in my green sanctuary
holding tightly to my own hands
waiting it out
There is a lull, and I start to wonder if it has passed
I reach up to peek outside
and the clamor begins anew
Fresh cleaving
a spatter across my leaf
(good leaf)
heaving sounds
After another eternity, things calm
a hazy silence falls
heavy like wool
Is this it? Has it finally passed?
I don't dare to hope, so I wait some more
and even fall asleep
Upon waking, it has grown light
a stillness covers the world
I tentatively peek out from under my careful home
the coast seems clear
Throwing caution to the wind, I emerge at once
to the greeting smiles of a thousand faces
All looking my way
