You rise on the edge of the desert
rise into an orange sky
cradling the head of a lizard
breathing fire

One hand open
guiding the land forward
one hand twisted
untangling the puzzle

Where can you find
a darker color?
It bleeds into the sand
and the creatures follow it
curious and blinking

This place can hold all of us
this dais of stone and fog
We inscribe the melting path
in its worn faces
and watch the world dissolve

There is always something swirling there
it occupies the space
where structure once reigned
a silent malice
that kills by waiting

May the dam fall
