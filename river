I look into this river
so clear, I only know the water
by a soft undulation of the sky
There are countless fish there
where it is hard to know
if there is any water between them
a flashing torrent
of scale and fin and eye
I know they have identity
but they also share a connection
to where it is hard to know
if they really are different fish going by
or if it is the same fish, recurring endlessly
reaching out
to itself
across water
that enshrouds its own reflection
A single leaf
comes lilting down
and strikes the surface
and with its eyes and scales
joins the fray
to where I cannot even distinguish
which is leaf
and which is fish
and around me everywhere
are other versions of me
gazing into the river
pondering this torrent of energy
that is the universe
as the water streams by
engulfing and propelling us
into ourselves
