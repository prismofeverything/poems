Somewhere, there lies
a small glowing
button
that if you press it
trumpets will blare
and a glowing blanket
will be dropped over the world
and we'll all be thrashing around
inside this blanket
trying to move around
but it will be pretty hard
(it's a big blanket
the size of a moon)
but we'll get by
and everyone will wonder
where this giant blanket
came from
and only you
will really know
although will you?
because you pressed the button
but how did that lead
to something like this giant blanket?
There has to be
an additional mechanism
between the button
and the blanket
and the trumpets
which how is that related
These trumpets are probably a clue
they just happened at the beginning
and became kind of drowned out
by the whole blanket thing
but really
Maybe it was about the trumpets
this whole time
