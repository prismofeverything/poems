In this world of illusion
I hit something solid
this is unusual
as the transient drifting through 
a kaleidoscope of images
does not in general
meet resistance
Solid
an object?
A real thing?
I reach out
through the cloud of multi-colored ponies
and touch it
It is real
it is there
My curiosity burning
I brush away the misty color
and behold the object
It is muted, grey
softly curved
and grips back
as I grip it
An inexorable protrusion
followed by another
and what I can only describe as "fingers"
now wrap mine
(subtly redder than before)
I gasp
and the mist clears further
scurrying away from this new phenomena
as if repelled
by substance
I see it is continuous
with an "arm"
and beyond that
a "body"
And before I know what is happening
I am staring into the eyes
of another being
What must be
a real being
And I think
we are both startled
at first
but then a new feeling
one of hope
and potential
rises unfamiliar in my chest
as this new being rises
to meet me
