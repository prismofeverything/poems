What really is a question?
I have wondered this many times
Something that demands an answer
Or implies one
But how does it do that?
Through what power does it operate
to evoke from the openness of all things
a specific response
An alignment, a constellation of structure
that fits in the space
defined by this entity
This mystery
this manipulator of implication
this catalyst of form
This intelligence that reaches
Tenderly
to compose the complement
the spines of the nettle
Merely by existing
it generates a field
that warps absence
into its lack
Like a fountain
of form
energy flows through it
and Answers emerge
a kaleidoscope of particularity
the raw paste of thought
And the Question
conducts their dance
and we birth
the question
births us
