I stand upon a disk of the moon
the flat platform glowing beneath me
wild striations of vibrant color arc above my head
The mountain approaches
floating majestically in the void
I call and a flock of birds follows my progress towards the obelisk
Zap! It fires, I dodge
Zap zap!! down goes a trusty eagle companion
My tears fire my cry
as I raise the staff my grandmother gave me
(with the soft words "be strong")
a great pulse of light issuing forth
and the mountain severing into two
the plasma from within smearing across the sky
incinerating the space itself
A loud bellowing wavefront
knocks us all backwards
and finally
though we cannot hear
we are smiling and cheering
and our grandchildren need not live in fear
