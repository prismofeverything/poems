I am round
my roundness
extending into space
Round like a world
a teeming layer
of tiny beings
inhabit the negative space
As I orbit
this burning star
rockets take off
for a better world
My agriculture
is waning
and multitudes go starving
Famine and ruin
an ashen smolder
blanket the lands
and I intrude there
bellowing magma
causing more devastation
in my misguided plea
for salvation
I know why they have created
this death cult
I want to help
but I end up flattening
their fragile cities
maybe they know better than I
and are just singing the song
I absently hum
without realizing it
I give them flowers
and they drown
in petals
but still teeming
they always survive
I cry
and my tears nourish
their dying farms
for awhile
Glowing
I set a field
down to slumber
and relax
and let the sprouts flourish
upon my flesh
until I am riddled with roots
and unfold in majestic bounty
a trillion mouths
devouring my substance
as I sigh
and let go
and dissolve
into minds
